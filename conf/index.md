The territories of computational design are ever-changing and represent a substantial region that remains uncharted; one with expanding and permeable boundaries that continue to be fully breached.  This ocean of opportunity implores researchers to embark on ambitious journeys of exploration. Undulating and temporal,  computational design needs research that engages explicitly with the innovative, intelligent and informed exploitation of computational design, and with the array of computational technologies that the discipline may engage with.

Human intelligence and creativity deliver the hegemonic direction for the field of computer-mediated architectural design research; an area where the computational component is a core aspect of the investigation. The actors in this are both witness to, and instigators of, the exciting, consequent, well-founded research that continues to deliver new knowledge, insights and information.
This, then, explains the specific overarching theme of the conference: ‘Intelligent & Informed’. 

The scope of this theme is driven by the intention to take in aspects of machine intelligence, and a wide range of potential research that engages with the intelligent exploitation of computer-mediated techniques in Architecture.

Within the coverage of the call lies a broad spectrum of approaches ranging from speculative, informal investigations to conventional scientific research, including but not limited to the following research and praxis topics. Papers, Posters, Roundtable, Workshops, & Postgraduate Student Consortium must address the conference theme 'Informed & Intelligent'.

## Paper Submissions
__Abstracts__: Abstracts will be subject to an initial review  (desirable - not required for full paper submission). Length ca 500 words plus key references. 

__Papers__: Full papers will be subject to a double-blind peer review of full-length manuscripts. Length: 10 pages fitting the CAADRIA format (ca. ~3000-4000 words).

Submission details, style and format are listed at the Submission page.  Publication of the paper will be subject to review acceptance, to compliance with submission deadlines and formatting guidelines, and to the payment of the conference registration fee. Conference must be attended in person.

* Submission via "Submissions" page
* Submission Deadline Abstract: 1st October 2018
* Submission Deadline Full Paper:10th December 2018

## Poster Submissions
In addition to full paper submissions the conference 'Intelligent & Informed' also invites posters on general topics in computational design research. It is planned that posters accepted will be included in a digital compendium of abstracts and posters.

* Submission via: caadria@vuw.ac.nz
* Submission Deadline: 10th February 2019

## Workshop Submissions
Workshops relating to the broader field of the conference topic Intelligent & Informed are sought. Workshops on advanced topics related to "Intelligent & Informed" providing considerable opportunity for discussion and are generally not run as mini-conferences. Proposals for workshops should contain the following information in no more than 800 words:

* Workshop title
* Name of Chair(s) plus email contact
* Members 
* Goals of the workshop
* Workshop format and details
* Submission via: caadria@vuw.ac.nz
* Submission Deadline: 10th February 2019

## Roundtable Session Submissions
Intelligent & Informed Round Table Session discusses in depth the conference theme and brings together the various current development in computational architecture. Proposals for workshops should contain the following information in no more than 500 words:

* Roundtable title
* Name of Chair(s) plus email contact
* Panel members
* Goals of the roundtable
* Format and details
* Submission via: caadria@vuw.ac.nz
* Submission Deadline: 10th February 2019

## Postgraduate Student Consortium Submissions
The Postgraduate Student Consortium provides a supportive setting for feedback on students' current research and guidance on future research directions. It promotes the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research. This is an excellent opportunity to network with colleagues of similar background or interests and from the international community. Students are asked to present their ongoing research work and results to date. They will have the chance to discuss their research in an informal session with peers and experienced academics from their field.

__Review Criteria__

- Originality of the work concerning current concepts and techniques
- Importance of the work concerning fundamental issues and themes
- Clearly defined research questions and aims, methodology, discussion
- Rigour and validity of argumentation, results, and interpretations
- Clarity and persuasiveness of expression.

__Applications__

Applications consist of:
* An extended abstract or full paper describing work in process and key questions addressed
* A one-page curriculum vitae (attached to the end of the paper)

* Submission via email to: pgsc@gmail.com
* Submission Deadline: 10th February 2019

## Young CAADRIA Award
Young CAADRIA Awards are funded by CAADRIA, given by a committee jointly by CAADRIA, the Paper Selection Committee, and the Conference Host and will be decided by them after the acceptance of papers. Awards will be applied to conference registration fees and are not transferable (e.g. awardees cannot assign them to co-authors). If an awardee does not attend the conference, no award will be given. Open to full or part-time registered students (PhD or Masters or undergraduate), chosen before the conference, winners exempt from paying registration fees. The student applies for award if the paper is selected for inclusion into the conference. Chosen on the merit of abstract, contribution and relevance to CAADRIA and demonstrated depth of research interest.

__Criteria__
- Clarity of concept
- Understanding of context
- Quality of writing
- Strength of research in CV
- Applicability to the broader architectural research
- Typically only one student per university per year.

__Application__
* Submission Deadline: 30th January 2019
* Submission via email: psc@caadria-review.org
* CV, list of publications, accepted paper and other supporting documents.
