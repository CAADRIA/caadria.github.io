In a time of unprecedented global challenges, the need for researchers and designers to reflect on our changing society has rarely been more obvious. As the pandemic highlights the precariousness of our fragile climate, limited resources and unequitable urban areas, there is a new mandate for research and innovation, searching for new technology-enabled processes that positively impact our profession, communities, and planet.

The advancement and adoption of new technologies in all aspects of our society have started to profoundly change the nature of architectural design and materialisation processes, bridging between the digital and the physical worlds. Fluid communication allows for unprecedented new levels of complexity, control and feedback between design and the built environment. Large quantities of information allow us to forecast how architectural and urban structures perform over time, against a detailed understanding of their contexts.

“PROJECTIONS” focuses on the implementation of our work, asking us to reflect upon the different ways innovation will impact the future of our industry. We will invite conversations and debate around the status of computational research and design, reflecting on recent challenges and opportunities, and how these translate into futures that are different from what was previously predicted. As we assess our projects within the context of our shared realities, we position our work as prototypes for alternative futures in our collective field.

The 2021 annual conference for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), will bring together academics, researchers and practitioners involved in innovating, disrupting or revolutionising processes for the conceptualisation, evaluation and materialisation of the built environment. By inviting participants from universities and practices throughout Asia, we aim to create a platform for shared moments of inspiration, reflection, and projection.
