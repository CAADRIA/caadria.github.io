What if we are already in the Anthropocene epoch where the function of the Earth system is being impacted by human activities? What if our actions indeed are significant enough to have a critical force on the Earth as a system? The term Anthropocene (the Age of Humans) has gained increasing recognition as a description of a crucial geological stage of our planet as we face the consequences of our own events on the earth’s ecosystem. While we are beginning to address the predominant challenges of sustainability and ecology, the environments we built have also shaped our behaviours.

To celebrate CAADRIA’s 25thAnniversary, we challenge ourselves with these questions, asking what we want our future to look like, in the next 25, 50, or even 100 years? If human creations are substantial enough to start a new geological epoch, what does this imply for our explorations of the realm of computational design, and how will advanced technologies shape our futures?

With the theme RE: Anthropocene, we challenge ourselves to REgard this new geological age as the main meaningful site for exploration into the future, REthink what our planet could become, REvisit our actions and behaviours to foster the REsponsibilities for the planet existence, and perhaps & importantly, REspond to whatever magnitudes happen to the built-environments and other planetary beings.
