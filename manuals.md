### Session Chairs
A conference site organizer will invite individuals to fill the role of “Session Chair”. The session chair will be a person who is cognizant of the research area discussed in their session. They should have sufficient familiarity with the field to read the papers in the session before hand; introduce the speakers in their context; moderate the question and answer session with knowledgeable directions; formulate questions to stimulate discussion after papers; and request the speaker to clarify issues or clarify issues themselves if the discussion requires such contribution. At the close of the session, a session chair should be able to summarize the session briefly. In addition, the chair may be asked convey ‘housekeeping’ notices as requested by the conference organizers.

### Conference sponsorship guidelines
* __General principle__: CAADRIA is an independent academic organization with no commercial interests, and should always appear to be so. CAADRIA and the host work together to present a conference for the benefit of scholars in computer-aided architectural design.
* __General guidelines__: CAADRIA has responsibility for academic content of the annual conference, i.e., paper review and selection process. The conference host plans, finances, and manages the conference. In particular, the host institution is responsible for financial planning and management of the conference. The conference host should plan the conference to break even, not generate profit, and accept complete financial responsibility for the conference.
* __Sponsorship principles__: Sponsorship serves several purposes:
  1. To enable mutually beneficial relationships between CAADRIA community and commercial entities;
  1. To provide cash flow before the registration fees have been collected; and
  1. To cover the difference between expenses and registration fees.
* __Sponsorship guidelines__: The host is empowered to organize sponsorship for that conference only. Sponsorship spanning more than one conference falls within the purview of CAADRIA.
  The host should arrange sponsorships in a way that upholds the independence and nonprofit nature of both CAADRIA and the conference. For example:
  1. The visibility of sponsors (for example, through their activities, products, publicity, logos, and representatives), while being fair to the sponsors, should not distract from the purpose of the conference
  1. A variety of commercial sponsors should be sought, to maintain a balanced presence.
  If the host has questions about the appropriateness of sponsorship plans, conference organizers consult in advance with the CAADRIA executive committee.
