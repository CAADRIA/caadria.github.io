*Artificial Realities: Virtual as an Aesthetic Medium for Architectural Ideation* was selected through an Open Call to be an Associated Project of Lisbon Architecture Triennale 2019 ‘*The Poetics of Reason*’. It is an exhibition coupled with a one-day symposium hosted and organized by ISTAR Information Sciences, Technology and Architecture Research Center, and taking place in Lisbon between 14th to 18th October 2019.

In the last decades we have witnessed a rapidly growing virtual reality industry from a variety of fields (games, construction, education, healthcare, animation, film-making, art, computer science) to become key innovators in designing immersive experiences. However, virtual reality as an aesthetic medium is still something relatively new. Although the technological side of virtual reality has evolved rapidly, the aesthetic side of the medium has remained in a nascent stage. The event will explore the ways in which virtual reality technologies can enable designers to expand and be integral to their creative process.
