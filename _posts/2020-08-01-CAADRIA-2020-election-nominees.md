## President
### Christiane Herr
Senior Associate Professor
Department of Architecture
Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University
Current President, CAADRIA

My name is Christiane M. Herr, I am currently Associate Professor at the Department of Architecture at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. For the past two years, I have served as the first female CAADRIA president. CAADRIA is not the achievement of one single individual but a big team effort - the Association relies heavily on the work of unpaid volunteers. I am proud of the milestones our team of Officers has accomplished in the past two years: among others we have improved the rigour and quality of our paper review process, revamped the website, conducted a competition for a new logo for the Association's 25th anniversary, clarified administrative procedures, revitalized the role and increased the number of the CAADRIA Fellows, created the new Sasada Prize and improved our internal role and process definitions. The 25th anniversary of CAADRIA falls into a time of great challenge and great change. Thanks to a generous and courageous host, we are holding CAADRIA2020 not only as the 25th anniversary conference but also as the first fully virtual conference. To me the next big question is how CAADRIA's spirit can be carried into the next generation of CAAD researchers in Asia? In the coming two years, we couldstart to chart a course in response to this question. I propose to further strengthen the quality of our research output by focusing less on printed proceedings and more on databases, indexing and possibly the assignment of DOIs to each published paper. Withgrowing numbers of our annual conferences, I propose we also need to establish more high quality journal venues for our research output. Now is also a good time to collectively revisit and possibly update the stated aims of CAADRIA, which were originally formulatedfor a time when CAAD was not yet established widely throughout Asia. With an increasingly digital mode of exchange, we will be able to explore digital and hybrid conference modes in the coming years, allowing access to our community for an even broader communityof researchers. We will also be able to better join forces with our sister organisations, with shared initiatives such as a global PhD workshop and more. Of course, all of these ideas will be enriched by yet more initiatives brought forward by the entire team of CAADRIA Officers. I would be proud to lead and coordinate this collective effort for two more years.

## Secretary
#### Urvi Sheth
Director Workshops and Exhibitions
CEPT University, Ahmedabad

With reference to trail email, I would like to nominate myself for the position of Secretary.

I am passionate about mixing technology and crafts. My research and practice has a global design approach which uses computational design, digital fabrication and regional/local in execution using regional craftsmanship. I hold dual positions. Academically I am Director of Workshops and Exhibitions at CEPT University (2014 - now) and principal architect of architectural practice Craft Quest since its inception in 2010. Both are based in Ahmedabad, India. I completed my postgraduate in Architecture from Hyperbody at Technical University, Delft, the Netherlands. 

I have been mentoring national innovation competitions and facilitating at workshops/creating learning experiences by foreign nations. I am associated with CAADRIA 2012, Chennai, India when I published my first paper in this conference. Following this, I also published in CAADRIA 2013, 2014 and 2020. My work has also been published in eCAADe 2019. Apart from that it has also caught the attention of reputed architectural magazines like Domus.

With my experience, managerial skills and leadership qualities, I will make a good support to the President.


## Treasurer
### Hyoung-June Park, Ph.D. 
Associate Professor of Design & Computation 
School of Architecture
University of Hawaii at Manoa
Hyoung-June Park

Aloha! my name is Hyoung-June Park. I am a faculty member in the School of Architecture at University of Hawaii at Manoa. Since2001, already two decades ago, I have participated in CAADRIA.Time flies like an arrow. Through this time, I believe CAADRIA hasbeen developed in breadth and depth not only in architecture butalso other design areas. Even though CAADRIA is going through the difficulties caused by Covid 19, it will come back to a normalstatus and flourish again soon. In this context, next two yearswill be a critical period for CAADRIA to recover and grow again. It will be my pleasure to serve for CAADRIA as a treasurer duringthis period......"Destitutus ventis, remos adhibe" (If the windwill not serve, take to the oars.)... Mahalo!

I currently hold a joint assistant professorship in Architecture & Sustainable Design (ASD) and Design& Artificial Intelligence (DAI) at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). After graduating from the Architectural Association (AA) in London, I moved on to complete my PhD at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland,doing transdisciplinary research work between the School of Computer Sciences and the Institute of Architecture. In addition to my regular  presentation of papers at past CAADRIAs, I have also served in several other roles, namely workshop leader, electioncommittee member, session chair and PSC member. From these experiences, I have not only gained some familiarity with the inner workings of the association, but also identified the constant need to inject creativity and energy to sustain its intellect impactwithin academia and industry. I hope that, by taking on the role of Membership Officer, I could play a more significant role in positively shaping the future of CAADRIA.
