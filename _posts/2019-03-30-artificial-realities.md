# Open Call: Artificial Realities – Virtual as an Aesthetic Medium in Architecture Ideation, Lisbon Architecture Triennale 2019

* ISCTE-IUL, 14-18 October 2019 Lisbon Portugal
* Submission deadline: July 1st 2019
* Website - [http://istar.iscte-iul.pt/artificialrealities/](http://istar.iscte-iul.pt/artificialrealities/)

*Artificial Realities: Virtual as an Aesthetic Medium for Architectural Ideation* was selected through an Open Call to be an Associated Project of Lisbon Architecture Triennale 2019 ‘*The Poetics of Reason*’. It is an exhibition coupled with a one-day symposium hosted and organized by ISTAR Information Sciences, Technology and Architecture Research Center, and taking place in Lisbon between 14th to 18th October 2019.

In the last decades we have witnessed a rapidly growing virtual reality industry from a variety of fields (games, construction, education, healthcare, animation, film-making, art, computer science) to become key innovators in designing immersive experiences. However, virtual reality as an aesthetic medium is still something relatively new. Although the technological side of virtual reality has evolved rapidly, the aesthetic side of the medium has remained in a nascent stage. The event will explore the ways in which virtual reality technologies can enable designers to expand and be integral to their creative process.

The work should discuss questions such as:

* What are the specific techniques, methodologies and processes of the virtual craft in terms of creative process?
* What does it offer differently in terms of experiences compared to physical and traditional modes of interaction?
* How do contemporary virtual reality projects explore the aesthetic potential of the medium?
* Will it reach mass adoption, and if so, when?
* How are virtual technologies changing the way we design and create? What is the balance with analogue processes?
* To what degree are educational curricula assimilating these technologies in pedagogy? What are the gains and challenges?
We plan to present a diverse and international group of projects by leading artists, designers and researchers that use virtual, mixed and augmented reality technologies as a creative medium. The projects will show evidence of not only the two cornerstones of VR: immersion and interaction but also that display an aesthetic dimension and strategy. 

Participation in the symposium may be done remotely by video conference.

Work may be submitted in two categories:

1. Short Papers / Work-In-Progress Papers
2. Projects for the Exhibition.

**Paper length:** 2,000 words with 3-4 images. max. 5 pages. The paper submission should include: 1. Introduction; 2. Literature review; 3. Methods (if appropriate); 4. Findings; 5. Discussion and Conclusion; 6. References

Projects for the exhibition submission should include a 500-word description and 3-4 images.

This is a blind and peer reviewed call. Papers and project submissions should not contain information that identifies their authors, their institutions, or their places of work.

Send your submissions to: sara.eloy@iscte-iul.pt

All work presented and exhibited will be published in a catalog and publication.
