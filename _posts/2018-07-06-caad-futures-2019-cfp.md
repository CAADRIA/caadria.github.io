Things are nothing without being defined by someone. All things including creation or social phenomenon have been given meaning through being understood.

In 2019, the theme of the conference is "Hello, Culture" borrowing from "Hello, World" which is used in all programming languages. As if to say hello to a new world, we are looking forward to meeting with a new cultural area. The new and diverse cultural areas will be defined through contemporary architectural, design, engineer and other researches.

CAAD Futures 2019, with its theme "Hello, Culture", warmly welcomes every contribution to understanding cultures in any shape or form. Subjects of the conference are as follows, but there are no limit.
