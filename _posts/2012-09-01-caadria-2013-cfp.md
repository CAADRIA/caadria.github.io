CAADRIA 2013 Open Systems ⎯ Call for Papers - Abstract due September 1, 2012

Call for Presentations of Practice Work - Due December 1, 2012

### Open Systems: The 18th International Conference of the Association of Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) May 15-18, 2013 National University of Singapore

Contemporary challenges require inclusively integrated approaches to designing. Constrained by established modes of practice, such integration is impossible without a radical commitment to openness. In response to this need, CAADRIA 2013 invites contributions that engage with open systems in all aspects of architectural and urban design: open with respect to the scale of the design objectives and the context, from a building component within a building system to a neighbourhood or city within its urban and rural context; open with respect to the domains being considered, from planning to sustainable performance of a building or city; open with respect to the collaboration of disciplines and participants, from ad-hoc brainstorming to a rigorous process of consultation and feedback; open with respect to design methods and techniques, from physical modelling to digital prototyping; open with respect to design models and representations being adopted, from a parametric exploration to an ontological delineation considering Building Information Modelling, Built Environment Modelling or City Information Modelling; open with respect to the tools and applications being adopted, despite interoperability issues, from modelling to simulation and assessment; open with respect to the learning approach being adopted, from informal interaction and sharing to formal design education; open with respect to the open source approach being adopted in research and development, in order to gather community involvement and use. By focusing on the theme of Open Systems, CAADRIA 2013 aims to explore all these aspects and more, and raise awareness to the need of overstepping disciplinary boundaries and reaching creative communities at all levels of expertise, by pooling resources, knowledge and practices, and integrating them through the adoption of open systems.

CAADRIA 2013 invites submissions of original research papers and presentations of practice work on topics in computational architectural design research, including but not limited to the following subjects:

• Computational design research and education
• Modes of production
• Digital fabrication and construction
• New design concepts and strategies 
• Mass customization 
• Collaborative design 
• Digital aids to design creativity 
• User participation in design 
• Generative, parametric and evolutionary design 
• Virtual architecture 
• Shape studies 
• Virtual reality and interactive environments 
• Precedence and prototypes 
• Ubiquitous and mobile design computing 
• Design tool development • Human-Computer Interaction 
• Simulation, prediction, and evaluation • City modelling 
• Practice-based and interdisciplinary computational design research 
• Theory, philosophy and methodology of computational design research

Young researchers currently involved in postgraduate studies are invited to apply for the Young CAADRIA Award and to submit their research-in-progress to the CAADRIA 2013 Postgraduate Student Consortium.
