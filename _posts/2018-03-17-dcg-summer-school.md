The workshop topics are:
1. Structural Weaving
2. Immersive and Responsive Environments
3. Web scraping and Data Mining
4. Capturing Walkability (new methods)

The Design Computation Summer School 2018 is an initiative of the Design and Computation Group (DCG) of Faculdade de Arquitetura, University of Lisbon.

It will be a space for discussing new ideas and new applications of advanced concepts in architecture and urbanism by exploring the given tools and methods. The main idea of this set of workshops is to share advanced knowledge on the related subjects and get feedback from the participants.

We expect to grow our network of highly specialized researchers and expand the use of our methods and tools by providing a hands-on experience.
