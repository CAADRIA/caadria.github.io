### Introduction

Boundaries in architecture become increasingly apparent when working in an international context. Boundaries can mean geographical borders or physical territories but also can refer to social, cultural and professional difference. Architectural practitioners working in an international or global context often find that while the projects are interna- tional, regulation and professional practice methods and procedures remain at the national level. The aims of this conference are to bring together practitioners, academics and professional bodies from across China and interna- tionally to discuss the key issues, challenges/opportunities, surrounding architectural practice in the global context and showcase the innovative and best practice methods architects develop. The conference will build a platform to share knowledge and foster collaborations in order to develop research links and practice collaborations between professional bodies, academia and industry.

We welcome paper and poster submissions on topics belonging to, or “crossing the boundaries” of the below four themes, and more in general relating to international architectural practice around the world. Both practitioners and academics, including postgraduate research students, are encouraged to submit abstracts and/or posters illustrat- ing research, critical reflections, best practices and case studies.

* Theme 1. Trans-national Architecture: Global Practice in the Local Context
* Theme 2. Architecture across Cultures: Making, Representation and Material
* Theme 3. Education and Professional Practice across Borders
* Theme 4. Future Cities, Sustainability, Workflows and BIM

Conference proceedings will be published with the University of Liverpool Press, and selected papers will be invit- ed to contribute to the Architecture across Boundaries edited book.
