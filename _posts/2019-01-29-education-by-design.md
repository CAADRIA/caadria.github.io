## CFP Reynolds Symposium: Education by Design, Portland OR, due Mar 1, 2019

We are at a critical transition in architectural education—one that must propel schools to address the urgency of the multiple challenges facing our current environment. Join us in engaging this transition at the [http://reynoldssymposium.uoregon.edu/](2019 Reynolds Symposium: Education by Design), in **Portland, Oregon, October 18-19, 2019**.

Through a **two-stage abstract and paper peer-review process**, we call on faculty, practitioners, content experts, and students to shape the future of design education. Synthesize, document, and share your most effective lessons; those that will move design toward building environments that are healthy, resilient, and carbon-emissions free. We plan multiple ways to capture the outcomes of the conference, one of which will be an edited book or journal of selected symposium papers.

**Proposals, due Mar 1, 2019**, must include innovative pedagogical content that relates to teaching and learning for design studios, lectures, or seminar courses. We are seeking presentations on these topics: Design Integration, Design for a Changing Climate, Digital Approaches, and Education in Practice. Presentations will take place as a single track in a venue that will hold approximately 120 people. The objective of the 2019 Reynolds Symposium is to gather significant and innovative pedagogical work from national and international scholars and practitioners. 

The Symposium will launch on Friday, October 18 with an evening keynote and reception, followed by full day on Saturday, October 19 at the University of Oregon’s White Stag Building in downtown Portland, OR. We’re also planning optional tours on Sunday, October 20. **A limited hotel room block has been reserved for participants**.  Confirmed keynotes are: Nina Maritz and Marsha Maytum/Bill Leddy/LMS Architects.
 
Past symposia held at the University of Oregon include The John Reynolds Sustainability Symposium in May 2015 to celebrate his work, influence, and contributions; and Transforming Architecture: A Festschrift Event in May 2017 honoring Professor G. Z. “Charlie” Brown organized by the Energy Studies in Buildings Laboratory (ESBL).
 
The **2019 Reynolds Symposium, Education by Design**, is supported by the University of Oregon Reynolds Sustainability Symposium Endowment, SBSE, the Jeffrey Cook Charitable Trust, the UO Technical Teaching program, and the UO Department of Architecture.
